# Python-Class-Design-Week-5
# 🧠 Python Assignment 1: Classes and Polymorphism

## 👤 Author: Amahle Mathebula (Yaniik)

## 📚 Description

This assignment covers two main activities in Python programming:

---

### ✅ Activity 1: Create Your Own Class

**Class:** `EnhancedSuperhero`  
A custom class inspired by Gojo (Jujutsu Kaisen) and Sung Jin-Woo (Solo Leveling).

#### Features:
- Shadow Manipulation 🌑  
- Limitless Inventory 🎒  
- Master Combat Skills 🥋  
- Telekinesis 🌀  
- Energy Manipulation 🔥  
- Super Speed ⚡  
- Infinity Control ♾️  

**Concepts Demonstrated:**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Custom methods and constructors

---

### ✅ Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

**Concept:** Same method, different behaviors.

#### Base Class: `Animal`

#### Subclasses:
- `Dog` → Runs on four legs 🐕  
- `Bird` → Flies through the sky 🐦  
- `Cat` → Moves silently with elegance 🐈‍⬛  

Each subclass redefines the `move()` method to show **polymorphism** in action.

## 💾 Files Included

- `superhero_class.py` – Custom superhero class with powerful features.
- `animal_polymorphism.py` – Demonstrates polymorphism using animals.
- `README.md` – You’re reading it! 😄
